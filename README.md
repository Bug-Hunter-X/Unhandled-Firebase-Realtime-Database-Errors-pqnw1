# Unhandled Firebase Realtime Database Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue in Firebase Realtime Database: unexpected errors when dealing with complex data structures or large datasets, particularly race conditions during concurrent updates.  The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a robust solution.

## Problem

The core issue revolves around the lack of clear error handling and the challenge in identifying the root cause of data inconsistencies resulting from race conditions.  Standard Firebase error handling mechanisms may not always provide sufficient detail to pinpoint the problem.

## Solution

The solution focuses on robust error handling, transactions, and potentially server-side logic (Cloud Functions) to ensure data integrity and consistency even in the face of concurrent updates.  Transactions help to prevent race conditions by ensuring that only one update at a time succeeds.
